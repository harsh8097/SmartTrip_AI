# SmartTrip_AI

The SmartTrip_AI Itinerary Planner is a smart web application that generates personalized, day-wise travel plans based on a user’s destination, interests, trip duration, and budget. It uses AI-powered language models to provide customized recommendations, along with an animated parallax user interface, live map preview, and audio narration for an engaging and modern travel planning experience.

This project uses the LLaMA 3.3 (70B) model via the Groq API for AI-based itinerary generation, with an interactive single-page interface built using Gradio.
